## 📊 Excel Project Highlights

An interactive dashboard built in Excel using:
- Pivot Tables
- Slicers
- Calculated Fields
- Custom color palette (inspired by IPL tones)

**Key Insights:**
- Top run scorers by team/season
- Best economy bowlers
- Player consistency across years
- Toss decision patterns by venue
- Player of the Match leaders

## 🐍 Python EDA Highlights

Using `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`, this analysis covers:

- Data parsing from 1000+ JSON IPL match files
- Feature engineering: Strike Rate, Economy, Dismissal types
- Correlation heatmaps
- Barplots, scatter plots, heatmaps, stacked visuals
- Chi-Square Test: Toss decision vs Match outcome
- Consistency metrics across seasons for batters & bowlers

📌 **Project Title:** _Beyond the Boundary: An EDA of IPL Data_
